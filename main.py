"""FastAPI application for the Hebrew Text Summarizer.

Exposes two routes that both render the same template: a GET that shows the
empty form and a POST that shows the result. Rendering server-side keeps the
application dependency-free on the client and means the page degrades to plain
HTML if JavaScript is unavailable.

All summarization work is delegated to :mod:`summarizer`; this module is
responsible only for HTTP concerns and for turning exceptions into messages
that are safe to display.
