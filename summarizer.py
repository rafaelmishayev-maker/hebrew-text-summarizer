"""Summarization logic for the Hebrew Text Summarizer.

This module isolates every interaction with the upstream AI provider so that
the web layer in ``main.py`` depends only on a single coroutine
(:func:`summarize_text`) and a small, well-defined exception hierarchy.
Keeping the provider details here means the transport can be swapped without
touching the routes or the templates.
